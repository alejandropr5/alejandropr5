### Hi there, I'm Alejandro Perdomo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronic Engineer and a student of Artificial Intelligence specialization, with a passion for technology and solving real-world problems. My journey includes various projects spanning machine learning, robotics, web applications, APIs, data analysis, computer vision, among others.

#### ðŸš€ My Projects:

- **[Genetic Decipher](https://github.com/alejandropr5/genetic-decipher)**
  - An open-source Python tool for deciphering cryptograms using genetic algorithms. The codebase follows strict coding standards, including formatting checks with Flake8, type hints with MyPy, and comprehensive testing with Pytest. To ensure compatibility across various Python versions, the project uses Tox for testing. Continuous integration workflows on GitHub run tests on each commit to maintain code quality.
  - **Technologies**: Python, Genetic Algorithms, Flake8, MyPy, Pytest, Tox, GitHub Workflows.

- **[Cryptogram Decoder](https://github.com/alejandropr5/cryptogram-decoder)**
  - An application to decode cryptograms, divided into frontend and backend. The backend uses Python and FastAPI with a custom package for genetic algorithms for decryption.
  - Technologies: Python, FastAPI, Streamlit.

- **[Twitter Clone](https://github.com/alejandropr5/twitter-clone)**
  - A Twitter-like web application with both frontend and backend components. The frontend is built with TypeScript and React, while the backend is powered by Python and FastAPI. It uses PostgreSQL for the database.
  - Technologies: TypeScript, React, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL.

- **[Linkscibe](https://github.com/alejandropr5/linkscibe)**
  - A web application that classifies and organizes web links as bookmarks using NLP, machine learning, and web scraping. The frontend is implemented in Streamlit, and the backend is built with Python, FastAPI, and uses PostgreSQL for data storage.
  - Technologies: Streamlit, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, NLP, Machine Learning, Beautiful Soup.

- **[2DOF Robot Teleop](https://github.com/alejandropr5/2dof-robot-teleop)**
  - A collection of ROS Noetic packages for teleoperating a 2-degree cylindrical robot. This project provides instructions for building and using the packages to control the robot in Gazebo simulations and via keyboard teleoperation.
  - **Technologies**: Python, XML, ROS Noetic, Gazebo.

- **[Walk-Cycle: Human Gait Tracking System](https://github.com/alejandropr5/walk-cycle)**
  - Combines hardware and software to track human gait using accelerometers and an Arduino. Includes a Java-based graphical interface for real-time data visualization.
  - Technologies: Java, Arduino, FastAPI.
